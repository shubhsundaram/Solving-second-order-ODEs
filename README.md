# Solving-second-order-ODEs
* Explanation of the code:

first the b'g'l'm values are provided as initial values to the insert box.

then the initials conditions are given for the initial position and initial velocity of the bob.

time value is given for 20 seconds.

using ode45 solver we defined the output variables as t and results respectievely,using the ode_func we given the input parameters to the function.

at plotting, the two columns which are observed in results section are plotted which perfectly shows the variation of position and velocity of bob with respect to time.
